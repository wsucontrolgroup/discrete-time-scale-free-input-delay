# Abstract
This paper studies regulated state synchronization of discrete-time homogeneous networks of non-introspective agents in presence of unknown non-uniform input delays. A scale free protocol is designed based on additional information exchange, which does not need any knowledge of the directed network topology and the spectrum of the associated Laplacian matrix. The proposed protocol is scalable and achieves state synchronization for any arbitrary number of agents. Meanwhile, an upper bound for the input delay tolerance is obtained, which explicitly depends on the agent dynamics.
